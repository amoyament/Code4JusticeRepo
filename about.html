        <h1>Our Impact</h1>
        <img src="Photos/OurImpactPhoto.jpeg" alt="photo of team mates holding hands" class="impactphoto">
        <p class="mainp">Our organization has been serving the Charlotte area since 2018. During that time, we've helped over 400 ex-convicts find gainful employment, reducing recidivism rates in the area by an estimated 15%. We work closely with local businesses to provide job training and placement services that meet their specific needs. Our partnerships with companies such as Yadkin Bank and Duke Energy have resulted in job placements in fields ranging from construction to finance, with starting salaries averaging around $35,000 per year. Our program has a success rate of over 80%, meaning that the vast majority of our clients are able to maintain steady employment for at least a year after placement. We believe that everyone deserves a second chance, and our impact on the Charlotte area is evidence that our approach is working.</p>
